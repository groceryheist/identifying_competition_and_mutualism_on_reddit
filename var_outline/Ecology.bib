The perspectives adopt different levels of analysis and produce contrasting views of the characteristic mode and tempo of organizational evolution. Population ecology limits investigation to evolutionary change unfolding within established populations, emphasizing factors that homogenize organizational forms and maintain population stability. Population ecology thus fails to explain how populations originate in the first place or how evolutionary change occurs through the proliferation of heterogeneous organizational types. Community ecology overcomes these limitations: it focuses on the rise and fall of populations as basic units of evolutionary change, simultaneously explaining forces that produce homogeneity and stability within populations and heterogeneity between them.},

Recently, game theory, evolutionary approaches and complex systems science have provided quantitative insights on the mechanisms of social consensus. However, the literature is vast and widely scattered across fields, making it hard for the single researcher to navigate it. This short review aims to provide a compact overview of the main dimensions over which the debate has unfolded and to discuss some representative examples. It focuses on those situations in which consensus emerges ‘spontaneously’ in the absence of centralized institutions and covers topics that include the macroscopic consequences of the different microscopic rules of behavioural contagion, the role of social networks and the mechanisms that prevent the formation of a consensus or alter it after it has emerged. Special attention is devoted to the recent wave of experiments on the emergence of consensus in social systems.},

The facts that time-varying parameter models are parameter rich and the time span of our data is relatively short motivate a desire for shrinkage. In constant coefficient regression models, the Bayesian Lasso is gaining increasing popularity as an effective tool for achieving such shrinkage. In this paper, we develop econometric methods for using the Bayesian Lasso with time-varying parameter models. Our approach allows for the coefficient on each predictor to be: (i) time varying; (ii) constant over time; or (iii) shrunk to zero. The econometric methodology decides automatically to which category each coefficient belongs. Our empirical results indicate the benefits of such an approach.

First, we discuss how to obtain datasets from the APIs published by many social media platforms. Then, we perform some of the most widely used computational analyses on a dataset of social media scholarship we extract from the Scopus bibliographic database’s API. We apply three methods: network analysis, topic modeling using latent Dirichlet allocation, and statistical prediction using machine learning. For each technique, we explain the method and demonstrate how it can be used to draw insights from our dataset. Our analyses reveal overlapping scholarly communities studying social media. We find that early social media research applied social network analysis and quantitative methods, but the most cited and influential work has come from marketing and medical research. We also find that publication venue and, to a lesser degree, textual features of papers explain the largest variation in incoming citations. We conclude with some consideration of the limitations of computational research and future directions.},

Their underlying technologies enhance these processes by providing infrastructures through which group-based communication can occur. Community administrators often make decisions about technologies with the goal of enhancing the user experience, but the impact of such decisions on how a community develops must also be considered. To shed light on this complex and under-researched phenomenon, we offer a model of key latent constructs influenced by technology choices and possible causal paths by which they have dynamic effects on communities. Two important community characteristics that can be impacted are community size (number of members) and community resilience (membership that is willing to remain involved with the community in spite of variability and change in the topics discussed). To model community development, we build on attraction-selection-attrition (ASA) theory, introducing two new concepts: participation costs (how much time and effort are required to engage with content provided in a community) and topic consistency cues (how strongly a community signals that topics that may appear in the future will be consistent with what it has hosted in the past). We use the proposed ASA theory of online communities (OCASA) to develop a simulation model of community size and resilience that affirms some conventional wisdom and also has novel and counterintuitive implications. Analysis of the model leads to testable new propositions about the causal paths by which technology choices affect the emergence of community size and community resilience, and associated implications for community sustainability.},

  abstract = {Increasingly, online discussion communities are used to support activities ranging from software development to political campaigns. An important feature of an online discussion community is its content boundaries, which are individual perceptions of what materials and discussions are part of the community and what are not, and how that community is related to others within a larger system. Yet in spite of its importance, many community infrastructures allow individual participants to reshape content boundaries by simultaneously associating their contributions with multiple online discussion communities. This reshaping behavior is a controversial aspect of the creation and management of many types of online discussion communities. On one hand, many communities explicitly discourage boundary reshaping behaviors in their frequently asked questions or terms-of-use document. On the other hand, community infrastructures continue to allow such reshaping behaviors. To explain this controversy, we theorize how the extent of boundary reshaping in an online discussion community has simultaneously positive and negative effects on its member dynamics and responsiveness. We test predictions about the conflicting effects of reshaping behaviors with 60 months of longitudinal data from 140 USENET newsgroups, focusing on cross-posting activities as a form of reshaping behavior. Empirical results are consistent with the proposed hypotheses that reshaping behaviors within a discussion community affect member dynamics and community responsiveness in both positive and negative ways. Taken together, the findings highlight the boundary-related design challenges faced by managers seeking to support ongoing activity within online discussion communities.},

  abstract = {As telecommunication networks become more common, there is an increasing interest in the factors underlying the development of online social structures. It has been proposed that these structures are new forms of organizing which are not subject to the same constraints as traditional social structures. However, from anecdotal evidence and case studies it is difficult to evaluate whether online social structures are subject to the same problems as traditional social structures. Drawing from prior studies of traditional social structures and empirical analyses of longitudinal data from a sample of Internet-based groups, this exploratory work considers the role of size and communication activity in sustainable online social structures. A resource-based theory of sustainable social structures is presented. Members contribute time, energy, and other resources, enabling a social structure to provide benefits for individuals. These benefits, which include information, influence, and social support, are the basis for a social structure's ability to attract and retain members. This model focuses on the system of opposing forces that link membership size as a component of resource availability and communication activity as an aspect of benefit provision to the sustainability of an online social structure. Analyses of data from a random sample of e-mail-based Internet social structures (listservs) indicate that communication activity and size have both positive and negative effects on a structure's sustainability. These results suggest that while the use of networked communication technologies may alter the form of communication, balancing the opposing impacts of membership size and communication activity in order to maintain resource availability and provide benefits for current members remains a fundamental problem underlying the development of sustainable online social structures.},

This rapidly evolving field has redefined how researchers test models and validate theories. Yet until now there has been no textbook that unites the latest methods and bridges the divide between theoretical and applied work. Fabio Canova brings together dynamic equilibrium theory, data analysis, and advanced econometric and computational methods to provide the first comprehensive set of techniques for use by academic economists as well as professional macroeconomists in banking and finance, industry, and government. This graduate-level textbook is for readers knowledgeable in modern macroeconomic theory, econometrics, and computational programming using RATS, MATLAB, or Gauss. Inevitably a modern treatment of such a complex topic requires a quantitative perspective, a solid dynamic theory background, and the development of empirical and numerical methods--which is where Canova's book differs from typical graduate textbooks in macroeconomics and econometrics. Rather than list a series of estimators and their properties, Canova starts from a class of DSGE models, finds an approximate linear representation for the decision rules, and describes methods needed to estimate their parameters, examining their fit to the data. The book is complete with numerous examples and exercises. Today's economic analysts need a strong foundation in both theory and application. Methods for Applied Macroeconomic Research offers the essential tools for the next generation of macroeconomists.},

We adopt as a benchmark a common specification in the literature, a BVAR with variables entering in levels and a prior modeled along the lines of Sims and Zha (International Economic Review 1998; 39: 949–968). We then consider optimal choice of the tightness, of the lag length and of both; evaluate the relative merits of modeling in levels or growth rates; compare alternative approaches to h-step-ahead forecasting (direct, iterated and pseudo-iterated); discuss the treatment of the error variance and of cross-variable shrinkage; and assess rolling versus recursive estimation. Finally, we analyze the robustness of the results to the VAR size and composition (using also data for France, Canada and the UK, while the main analysis is for the USA). We obtain a large set of empirical results, but the overall message is that we find very small losses (and sometimes even gains) from the adoption of specification choices that make BVAR modeling quick and easy, in particular for point forecasting. This finding could therefore further enhance the diffusion of the BVAR as an econometric tool for a vast range of applications. Copyright © 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Abstract Multivariate autoregressive (MAR) models are an increasingly popular technique to infer interaction strengths between species in a community and to predict the community response to environmental change. The most commonly employed MAR(1) models, with one time lag, can be viewed either as multispecies competition models with Gompertz density dependence or, more generally, as a linear approximation of more complex, nonlinear dynamics around stable equilibria. This latter interpretation allows for broader applicability, but may come at a cost in terms of interpretation of estimates and reliability of both short- and long-term predictions. We investigate what these costs might be by fitting MAR(1) models to simulated 2-species competition, consumer-resource and host?parasitoid systems, as well as a larger food web influenced by the environment. We review how MAR(1) coefficients can be interpreted and evaluate how reliable are estimates of interaction strength, rank, or sign; accuracy of short-term forecasts; as well as the ability of MAR(1) models to predict the long-term responses of communities submitted to environmental change such as PRESS perturbations. The net effects of species j on species i are usually (90\%-95\%) well recovered in terms of sign or rank, with the notable exception of overcompensatory dynamics. In actual values, net effects of species j on species i are not well recovered when the underlying dynamics are nonlinear. MAR(1) models are better at making short-term qualitative forecasts (next point going up or down) than at predicting long-term responses to environmental perturbations, which can be severely over- as well as underestimated. We conclude that when applying MAR(1) models to ecological data, inferences on net effects among species should be limited to signs, or the Gompertz assumption should be tested and discussed. This particular assumption on density-dependence (log-linearity) is also required for unbiased long-term predictions. Overall, we think that MAR(1) models are highly useful tools to resolve and characterize community dynamics, but we recommend to use them in conjunction with alternative, nonlinear models resembling the ecological context in order to improve their interpretation in specific applications.},

  abstract = {In 2015, Reddit closed several subreddits-foremost among them r/fatpeoplehate and r/CoonTown-due to violations of Reddit's anti-harassment policy. However, the effectiveness of banning as a moderation approach remains unclear: banning might diminish hateful behavior, or it may relocate such behavior to different parts of the site. We study the ban of r/fatpeoplehate and r/CoonTown in terms of its effect on both participating users and affected subreddits. Working from over 100M Reddit posts and comments, we generate hate speech lexicons to examine variations in hate speech usage via causal inference methods. We find that the ban worked for Reddit. More accounts than expected discontinued using the site; those that stayed drastically decreased their hate speech usage-by at least 80\%. Though many subreddits saw an influx of r/fatpeoplehate and r/CoonTown "migrants," those subreddits saw no significant changes in hate speech usage. In other words, other subreddits did not inherit the problem. We conclude by reflecting on the apparent success of the ban, discussing implications for online moderation, Reddit and internet communities more broadly.},

In this framework, highly committed members participate to a greater degree than less committed members, and maintain their connection with the group over longer periods of time. Less committed members, on the other hand, participate sporadically, and tend to drop their memberships easily. This commitment thesis implies a positive relationship between participation and persistence: the more the member participates, the longer the duration of membership. We argue that this individual level thesis should be supplanted by a system level understanding, in which the competition among social groups for individual resources determines persistence and participation. This competition thesis predicts a negative relationship between persistence of membership and participation in group activities: the more the member participates, the shorter the average duration of membership. We use event history analysis to test these opposing hypotheses on a sample of 1587 membership spells covering a fifteen year time period. We find strong and consistent support for the competition thesis.},

Linguistic change—in the sense of innovation that becomes accepted as the norm—is essential to this dynamic process: it both facilitates individual expression and fosters the emergence of a collective identity. We propose a framework for tracking linguistic change as it happens and for understanding how specific users react to these evolving norms. By applying this framework to two large online communities we show that users follow a determined two-stage lifecycle with respect to their susceptibility to linguistic change: a linguistically innovative learning phase in which users adopt the language of the community followed by a conservative phase in which users stop changing and the evolving community norms pass them by.},

However, many systems do not emphasize or support explicit linking between people (e.g., Wikipedia or Reddit), and even fewer explicitly link communities. Instead, network analysis is performed through inference on implicit connections, such as co-authorship or text similarity. Depending on how inference is done and what data drove it, different networks may emerge. While correlated structures often indicate stability, in this work we demonstrate that differences, or misalignment, between inferred networks also capture interesting behavioral patterns. For example, high-text but low-author similarity often reveals communities "at war" with each other over an issue or high-author but low-text similarity can suggest community fragmentation. Because we are able to model edge direction, we also find that asymmetry in degree (in-versus-out) co-occurs with marginalized identities (subreddits related to women, people of color, LGBTQ, etc.). In this work, we provide algorithms that can identify misaligned links, network structures and communities. We then apply these techniques to Reddit to demonstrate how these algorithms can be used to decipher inter-group dynamics in social media.},

For nearly two decades, tens of thousands of dial-up computer networks were run out of the homes and offices of hobbyists, volunteers, and entrepreneurs throughout North America. It was on these bulletin board systems that personal computer owners first began to use their machines for popular communication. The history of BBSing portrays amateurs, hobbyists, and enthusiasts as key agents in the development and diffusion of social computing. Indeed, the users and administrators of early BBSes were the first to confront the fundamental challenges of living and working in online communities. Their experiences and experiments with anonymity, identity, privacy, sexuality, and trust established norms and values that were reproduced in the commercial services and social media systems to follow. Restoring the popular memory of the BBS movement confers legitimacy on amateur users to speak with authority about the present and future of internet technology and policy.},

We analyze the motivations and goals of wiki creators, finding that founders have diverse reasons for starting wikis and diverse ways of defining their success.

We also find that founders with differing goals approach community building differently.

The structure of social networks, which affects the dynamics of cooperation and other interpersonal phenomena, have common structural signatures. One of these signatures is the tendency to organize as groups. This tendency gives rise to networks with community structure, which are composed of distinct modules. In this paper, we study analytically the evolutionary game dynamics on large modular networks in the limit of weak selection. We obtain novel analytical conditions such that natural selection favours cooperation over defection. We calculate the transition point for each community to favour cooperation. We find that a critical inter-community link creation probability exists for given group density, such that the overall network supports cooperation even if individual communities inhibit it. As a byproduct, we present solutions for the critical benefit-to-cost ratio which perform with remarkable accuracy for diverse generative network models, including those with community structure and heavy-tailed degree distributions. We also demonstrate the generalizability of the results to arbitrary two-player games.},

Issues of governance in these Internet platforms and other digital institutions have posed a challenge for software engineers, many of whom have little exposure to the relevant history or theory of institutional design. Here, we offer one useful framework with an aim to stimulate dialogue between computer scientists and political scientists. The dominant guiding practices for the design of digital institutions to date in human-computer interaction, computer-supported cooperative work, and the tech industry at large have been an incentive-focused behavioral engineering paradigm, a collection of atheoretical approaches such as A/B-testing, and incremental issue-driven software engineering. One institutional analysis framework that has been useful in the design of traditional institutions is the body of resource governance literature known as the “Ostrom Workshop”. A key finding of this literature that has yet to be broadly incorporated in the design of many digital institutions is the importance of including participatory change process mechanisms in what is called a “constitutional layer” of institutional design—in other words, defining rules that allow and facilitate diverse stakeholder participation in the ongoing process of institutional design change. We explore to what extent this consideration is met or could be better met in three varied cases of digital institutions: cryptocurrencies, cannabis informatics, and amateur Minecraft server governance. Examining such highly varied cases allows us to demonstrate the broad relevance of constitutional layers in many different types of digital institutions.},

  abstract = {Open Source Software Development is an approach to software development involving open, public exposure of the source code of a computer program under development (hence, ‘open source’). Each open source program is shared online as a project in a source code repository.  The so-called ‘open source community’ is the system which coordinates the work of software developers on the code in the repositories. This research explored the growth dynamics of this system, first by launching open source projects and then via simulation. Following (Barabasi \& Albert, 1999) and a biodiversity model (Hubbell, 2001), simulations of a complex system driven by preferential attachment, where popular projects attract more developers and grow (subject to some attrition), provided a systematic explanation for the lack of growth typical of single-developer projects. In this multi-methodological study, the lack of growth in the research projects empirically demonstrated the need for a theoretical understanding of open source project initiation and growth while the subsequent simulation results showed how the pattern of no growth (one developer) projects could be explained by a simple model.},

This research examines how users value virtual communities and how virtual communities differ in their value propositions. In particular, this research examines the nature of trade-offs between information quantity and quality, and explores the sources of positive and negative externalities in virtual communities. The analyses are based on more than 500,000 postings collected from three large virtual investing-related communities (VICs) for 14 different stocks over a period of four years. The findings suggest that the VICs engage in differentiated competition as they face trade-offs between information quantity and quality. This differentiation among VICs, in turn, attracts users with different characteristics. We find both positive and negative externalities at work in virtual communities. We propose and validate that the key factor that determines the direction of network externalities is posting quality. The contributions of the study include the extension of our understanding of the virtual community evaluation by users, the exposition of competition between virtual communities, the role of network externalities in virtual communities, and the development of an algorithmic methodology to evaluate the quality (noise or signal) of textual data. The insights from the study provide useful guidance for design and management of VICs.},

  abstract = {Open collaboration systems, such as Wikipedia, need to maintain a pool of volunteer contributors to remain relevant. Wikipedia was created through a tremendous number of contributions by millions of contributors. However, recent research has shown that the number of active contributors in Wikipedia has been declining steadily for years and suggests that a sharp decline in the retention of newcomers is the cause. This article presents data that show how several changes the Wikipedia community made to manage quality and consistency in the face of a massive growth in participation have ironically crippled the very growth they were designed to manage. Specifically, the restrictiveness of the encyclopedia’s primary quality control mechanism and the algorithmic tools used to reject contributions are implicated as key causes of decreased newcomer retention. Furthermore, the community’s formal mechanisms for norm articulation are shown to have calcified against changes—especially changes proposed by newer editors.},

The commonly used tools--first-order logic and its foundational set theory--are ill-suited for handling these complications. Here, three leading authorities rethink organization theory. Logics of Organization Theory sets forth and applies a new language for theory building based on a nonmonotonic logic and fuzzy set theory. In doing so, not only does it mark a major advance in organizational theory, but it also draws lessons for theory building elsewhere in the social sciences. Organizational research typically analyzes organizations in categories such as "bank," "hospital," or "university." These categories have been treated as crisp analytical constructs designed by researchers. But sociologists increasingly view categories as constructed by audiences. This book builds on cognitive psychology and anthropology to develop an audience-based theory of organizational categories. It applies this framework and the new language of theory building to organizational ecology. It reconstructs and integrates four central theory fragments, and in so doing reveals unexpected connections and new insights."--Publisher description.},

A number of theories have emerged to explain its success, mainly from economics and law. We analyze a very large sample of OSS projects and find striking patterns in the overall structure of the development community. The distribution of projects on a range of activity measures is spectacularly skewed, with only a relatively tiny number of projects showing evidence of the strong collaborative activity which is supposed to characterize OSS. Our findings are consistent with prior, smaller-scale empirical research. We argue that these findings pose problems for the dominant accounts of OSS. We suggest that the gulf between active and inactive projects may be explained by social-structural features of the community which have received little attention in the existing literature. We suggest some hypotheses that might better predict the observed ecology of projects.},

Using examples from published empirical studies, the chapter describes five key benefits of this approach. First, it argues that population-level research increases the generalizability of findings. Next, it describes four processes and dynamics that are only possible to study using populations: community-level variables, information diffusion processes across communities, ecological dynamics, and multilevel community processes.

However, the same study suggested that only 39.9\% of Wikipedia readers in the US were female – a finding contradicted by a representative survey of American adults by the Pew Research Center conducted less than two months later. Combining these two datasets through an application and extension of a propensity score estimation technique used to model survey non-response bias, we construct revised estimates, contingent on explicit assumptions, for several of the Wikimedia Foundation and United Nations University at Maastricht claims about Wikipedia editors. We estimate that the proportion of female US adult editors was 27.5\% higher than the original study reported (22.7\%, versus 17.8\%), and that the total proportion of female editors was 26.8\% higher (16.1\%, versus 12.7\%).},

First, current practices for evaluating predictions must be better standardized. Second, theoretical limits to predictive accuracy in complex social systems must be better characterized, thereby setting expectations for what can be predicted or explained. Third, predictive accuracy and interpretability must be recognized as complements, not substitutes, when evaluating explanations. Resolving these three issues will lead to better, more replicable, and more useful social science.},

  abstract = {Natural ecological communities are continuously buffeted by a varying environment, often making it difficult to measure the stability of communities using concepts requiring the existence of an equilibrium point. Instead of an equilibrium point, the equilibrial state of communities subject to environmental stochasticity is a stationary distribution, which is characterized by means, variances, and other statistical moments. Here, we derive three properties of stochastic multispecies communities that measure different characteristics associated with community stability. These properties can be estimated from multispecies time-series data using first-order multivariate autoregressive (MAR(1)) models. We demonstrate how to estimate the parameters of MAR(1) models and obtain confidence intervals for both parameters and the measures of stability. We also address the problem of estimation when there is observation (measurement) error. To illustrate these methods, we compare the stability of the planktonic communities in three lakes in which nutrient loading and planktivorous fish abundance were experimentally manipulated. MAR(1) models and the statistical methods we present can be used to identify dynamically important interactions between species and to test hypotheses about stability and other dynamical properties of naturally varying ecological communities. Thus, they can be used to integrate theoretical and empirical studies of community dynamics.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we develop methods for estimation and forecasting in large time-varying parameter vector autoregressive models (TVP-VARs). To overcome computational constraints, we draw on ideas from the dynamic model averaging literature which achieve reductions in the computational burden through the use forgetting factors. We then extend the TVP-VAR~so that its dimension can change over time. For instance, we can have a large TVP-VAR as the forecasting model at some points in time, but a smaller TVP-VAR at others. A final extension lies in the development of a new method for estimating, in a time-varying manner, the parameter(s)~of the shrinkage priors commonly-used with large VARs. These extensions are operationalized through the use of forgetting factor methods and are, thus, computationally simple. An empirical application involving forecasting inflation, real output and interest rates demonstrates the feasibility and usefulness of our approach.},

Kropotkin based this classic on his observations of natural phenomena and history, forming a work of stunning and well-reasoned scholarship. Essential to the understanding of human evolution as well as social organization, it offers a powerful counterpoint to the tenets of Social Darwinism. It also cites persuasive evidence of human nature's innate compatibility with anarchist society."Kropotkin's basic argument is correct," noted evolutionary biologist Stephen Jay Gould. "Struggle does occur in many modes, and some lead to cooperation among members of a species as the best pathway to advantage for individuals." Anthropologist Ashley Montagu declared that "Mutual Aid will never be any more out of date than will the Declaration of Independence. New facts may increasingly become available, but we can already see that they will serve largely to support Kropotkin's conclusion that 'in the ethical progress of man, mutual support—not mutual struggle—has had the leading part.'" Physician and author Alex Comfort asserted that "Kropotkin profoundly influenced human biology by his theory of Mutual Aid. . . . He was one of the first systematic students of animal communities, and may be regarded as the founder of modern social ecology."},

Based on the data between 1997 and 2005 collected from the records of development projects in the field of Information and Communication Technology for Development, the study demonstrates that dynamics in one network are significant drivers of tie formation in the other network at both dyadic and triadic levels. In particular, results show that the effects of common third-party ties and structural embeddedness exist across multiplex networks. Further, the study suggests that resource similarity of organizational dyads, resource width, and organizational centrality have positive effects on the propensity for multiplex ties. These results have implications for organizations' communication networking strategies in a wide variety of organizational communities.},

Unfortunately, this potential is not always fulfilled: many communities fail, and designers don't have a solid understanding of why. We know community activity begets activity. The trick, however, is to inspire participation in the first place. Social theories suggest methods to spark positive community participation. We carried out a field experiment that tested two such theories. We formed discussion communities around an existing movie recommendation web site, manipulating two factors: (1) similarity-we controlled how similar group members' movie ratings were; and (2) uniqueness-we told members how their movie ratings (with respect to a discussion topic) were unique within the group. Both factors positively influenced participation. The results offer a practical success story in applying social science theory to the design of online communities.},

Inspired from recent advance in causality detection in complex ecosystems, we propose to take advantage of a novel nonlinear state space reconstruction based approach, namely Convergent Cross Mapping, to perform causal inference in social media. Experimental results on real world social media datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed method in causal inference and user behavior prediction in social media.},

This essay presents a set of concepts and related propositions drawn from a resource mobilization perspective. It emphasizes the variety and sources of resources; the relationship of social movements to the media, authorities, and other parties; and the interaction among movement organizations. Propositions are developed to explain social movement activity at several levels of inclusiveness-the social movement sector, the social movement industry, and social movement organization.},

This dynamic model is related to the niche concept in a novel way, which produces an easily understood and powerful picture of the static and dynamic structure of the community. This new perspective provides a theoretical link between the aggregate macrostructural theory of Blau (1977a,b) and the microstructural dynamics of organizational demography (Pfeffer, 1983).

The theory combines an image of social network structure with the concept of natural selection to model changes in group composition over time. We consider the group to be a population of members subject to natural selection in sociodemographic space. According to the theory, the probability that members will enter or leave the group depends upon the number and strength of social network ties that connect group members to each other and to nonmembers. We analyze an event history dataset constructed from interviews using the Life History Calendar method and information on ego-centered social networks developed from the General Social Survey Network Module. We test the hypothesis that network connections inside a group are associated with reduced membership turnover, while connections outside the group increase turnover. We find that weak ties and network connections that span greater distances in sociodemographic space are positively correlated with leaving current groups and joining new ones. We conclude that weak ties are a major source of change in group composition.]},

Building on both political process and collective identity perspectives, this paper uses a case study of the women's movement's impact on U.S. peace movement activity in the 1980s to develop a theory of movement-movement influence. We argue that this influence is shown by: 1) the adoption of feminist ideological frames by the peace movement; 2) the spread of the women's movement's tactical innovations into peace protest; 3) increased presence of women in leadership positions in both the institutionally-oriented and direct action wings of the movement; and 4) the adoption of organizational structures that built on feminist processes designed to avoid hierarchy. Drawing data from both movements at local and national levels, we suggest four mechanisms of transmission between the movements: 1) organizational coalitions; 2) overlapping social movement communities; 3) shared personnel; and 4) broader changes in the external environment. Social movement spillover effects have implications for our understanding of both the continuity and impact of social protest movements.},

  abstract = {Organizational communities are typically defined as populations of organizations that are tied together by networks of communication and other relations in overlapping resource niches. Traditionally, evolutionary theorists and researchers have examined organizational populations that comprise organizational communities by focusing on their properties rather than on the networks that link them. However, a full understanding of the evolution of organizational communities requires insight into both organizations and their networks. Consequently, this article presents a variety of conceptual tools for applying evolutionary theory to organizations, organizational communities, and their networks, including the notions of relational carrying capacity and linkage fitness. It illustrates evolutionary principles, such as variation, selection, and retention, that lead to the formation, growth, maintenance, and eventual demise of communication and other network linkages. This perspective allows us to understand the ways in which community survival and success are as dependent on their communication linkages as they are on the organizations they connect. The article concludes with suggestions for potential applications of evolutionary theory to other areas of human communication.},

New York, New York: ACM Press. http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2998181.2998307 The published paper contains two studies. Study 1 is a descriptive analysis of a survey of Wikipedia editors who played a gamified tutorial. Study 2 is a field experiment that evaluated the same the tutorial. These data are the data used in the field experiment described in Study 2.  Description of Files This dataset contains the following files beyond this README:  twa.RData — An RData file that includes all variables used in Study 2. twa\_analysis.R — A GNU R script that includes all the code used to generate the tables and plots related to Study 2 in the paper.  The RData file contains one variable (d) which is an R dataframe (i.e., table) that includes the following columns:  userid (integer): The unique numerical ID representing each user on in our sample. These are 8-digit integers and describe public accounts on Wikipedia.  sample.date (date string): The day the user was recruited to the study. Dates are formatted in “YYYY-MM-DD” format. In the case of invitees, it is the date their invitation was sent. For users in the control group, these is the date that they would have been invited to the study.  edits.all (integer): The total number of edits made by the user on Wikipedia in the 180 days after they joined the study. Edits to user's user pages, user talk pages and subpages are ignored.  edits.ns0 (integer): The total number of edits made by user to article pages on Wikipedia in the 180 days after they joined the study.  edits.talk (integer): The total number of edits made by user to talk pages on Wikipedia in the 180 days after they joined the study. Edits to a user's user page, user talk page and subpages are ignored.  treat (logical): TRUE if the user was invited, FALSE if the user was in control group.  play (logical): TRUE if the user played the game. FALSE if the user did not. All users in control are listed as FALSE because any user who had not been invited to the game but played was removed.  twa.level (integer): Takes a value 0 of if the user has not played the game. Ranges from 1 to 7 for those who did, indicating the highest level they reached in the game.  quality.score (float). This is the average word persistence (over a 6 revision window) over all edits made by this userid. Our measure of word persistence (persistent word revision per word) is a measure of edit quality developed by Halfaker et al. that tracks how long words in an edit persist after subsequent revisions are made to the wiki-page. For more information on how word persistence is calculated, see the following paper:  Halfaker, Aaron, Aniket Kittur, Robert Kraut, and John Riedl. 2009. “A Jury of Your Peers: Quality, Experience and Ownership in Wikipedia.” In Proceedings of the 5th International Symposium on Wikis and Open Collaboration (OpenSym '09), 1–10. New York, New York: ACM Press. doi:10.1145/1641309.1641332.  Or this page: https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Research:Content\_persistence     How we created twa.RData The files twa.RData combines datasets drawn from three places:  A dataset created by Wikimedia Foundation staff that tracked the details of the experiment and how far people got in the game. The variables userid, sample.date, treat, play, and twa.level were all generated in a dataset created by WMF staff when The Wikipedia Adventure was deployed. All users in the sample created their accounts within 2 days before the date they were entered into the study. None of them had received a Teahouse invitation, a Level 4 user warning, or been blocked from editing at the time that they entered the study. Additionally, all users made at least one edit after the day they were invited. Users were sorted randomly into treatment and control groups, based on which they either received or did not receive an invite to play The Wikipedia Adventure.  Edit and text persistence data drawn from public XML dumps created on May 21st, 2015. We used publicly available XML dumps to generate the outcome variables, namely edits.all, edits.ns0, edits.talk and quality.score. We first extracted all edits made by users in our sample during the six month period since they joined the study, excluding edits made to user pages or user talk pages using. We parsed the XML dumps using the Python based wikiq and MediaWikiUtilities software online at:  http://projects.mako.cc/source/?p=mediawiki\_dump\_tools https://github.com/mediawiki-utilities/python-mediawiki-utilities  We obtained the XML dumps from: https://dumps.wikimedia.org/enwiki/  A list of edits made by users in our study that were subsequently deleted, created on August 3rd, 2015. The WMF staff created a dataset that listed all the edits made by users in our study that were deleted before August 3rd, 2015. We made the decision to include these edits in our counts, so as to measure the total level of participation undertaken by each editor. If a user in our study made article or talk page edits that were subsequently deleted, we would use the deleted edit logs to identify them, and increment the variables edits.all, edits.ns0, and edits.talk as appropriate. We decided that all edits drawn from the deleted edit logs would be defined to have an edit persistence score of 0, since they were deleted from Wikipedia.   We “manually” merged these datasets together.   Contact Us For more details about the dataset, please see our paper.

  abstract = {Integrating new users into a community with complex norms presents a challenge for peer production projects like Wikipedia. We present The Wikipedia Adventure (TWA): an interactive tutorial that offers a structured and gamified introduction to Wikipedia. In addition to describing the design of the system, we present two empirical evaluations. First, we report on a survey of users, who responded very positively to the tutorial. Second, we report results from a large-scale invitation-based field experiment that tests whether using TWA increased newcomers' subsequent contributions to Wikipedia. We find no effect of either using the tutorial or of being invited to do so over a period of 180 days. We conclude that TWA produces a positive socialization experience for those who choose to use it, but that it does not alter patterns of newcomer activity. We reflect on the implications of these mixed results for the evaluation of similar social computing systems.},

In plant and animal societies competition is unrestricted by an institutional or moral order. Human society is a consequence and effect of this limitation of the symbiotic social order by the cultural. Different social sciences are concerned with the forms which this limitation of the natural or ecological social order assumes on (1) the economic, (2) the political, and (3) the moral level.},

We present a method for reconstruction of the coupling matrix from a time series of irregular firing rates. The approach is based on the particular property of the nonlinearity in the coupling, as the latter is determined by a sigmoidal gain function. We demonstrate that for a large enough data set and a small measurement noise, the method gives an accurate estimation of the coupling matrix and of other parameters of the system, including the gain function.},

  abstract = {This article proposes that meaningful social classification emerges from an ecological dynamic that operates in two planes: feature space and label space. It takes a dynamic view of classification, allowing objects’ movements in both spaces to change the meaning of social categories. The first part of the theory argues that agents assign labels to objects based on perceptions of their similarities to existing members of a category. The second part of the theory shows that an object’s perceived similarity to members of other categories reduces its typicality in a focal category. This means that for categories with a high degree of overlap with other categories in label space (lenient categories), the link between feature-based similarities and labeling weakens. The findings suggest that social classification will likely evolve to contain both constraining and lenient categories. The theory implies that this process is self-reinforcing, so that constraining categories become more constraining, whereas lenient categories become more lenient.},

Voluntary organizations lose fastest those members who are either atypical of the group (the niche edge hypothesis) or subject to competition from other groups (the niche overlap hypotheis). The authors analyze an event-history data set, generated by the life-history calendar approach, of 2,813 voluntary association membership pells. The results, which strongly support both the niche edge and niche overlap hypotheses, substantiate the competitive ecological model of group structure.},

Four alternative logics of attachment—accumulative advantage, homophily, follow‐the‐trend, and multiconnectivity—are tested to explain the structure and dynamics of interorganizational collaboration in biotechnology. Using multiple novel methods, the authors demonstrate how different rules for affiliation shape network evolution. Commercialization strategies pursued by early corporate entrants are supplanted by universities, research institutes, venture capital, and small firms. As organizations increase their collaborative activities and diversify their ties to others, cohesive subnetworks form, characterized by multiple, independent pathways. These structural components, in turn, condition the choices and opportunities available to members of a field, thereby reinforcing an attachment logic based on differential connections to diverse partners.},

Drawing on a repeated cross-sectional study of credit evaluations during the postbellum period (1870–1900), our empirical analyses suggest that organizational membership in multiple categories need not be problematic when classification systems themselves are emergent or in flux and when organizations avoid rare combinations or identities involving ambiguous components. As Dun's schema became institutionalized, boundaries between industries were more clearly defined and boundary violations became subject to increased attention and penalty by credit reporters. Our perspective highlights the utility of an evolutionary perspective and tests its implications for the salience of distinct mechanisms of hybridity.},

A second model is analytic and deals with compartmented space. A final section applies the analytics to ‘neighborhood tipping.’ The systemic effects are found to be overwhelming: there is no simple correspondence of individual incentive to collective results. Exaggerated separation and patterning result from the dynamics of movement. Inferences about individual motives can usually not be drawn from aggregate patterns. Some unexpected phenomena, like density and vacancy, are generated. A general theory of ‘tipping’ begins to emerge.},

However, many peer production projects exhibit entrenched leadership and deep inequalities, suggesting that they may not fulfill democratic ideals. Instead, peer production projects may conform to Robert Michels' “iron law of oligarchy,” which proposes that democratic membership organizations become increasingly oligarchic as they grow. Using exhaustive data of internal processes from a sample of 683 wikis, we construct empirical measures of participation and test for increases in oligarchy associated with growth  in wikis' contributor bases. In contrast to previous studies, we find support for Michels' iron law and conclude that peer production entails oligarchic organizational forms.},

But organizations also comprise a primary context where people form social ties. We investigate how the network structure an organization creates among its members influences its ability to grow and reproduce. In particular, we propose that two dimensions of organizational strategy influence affiliation dynamics: (1) the extent to which an organization induces social interaction among its members (social encapsulation), and (2) the time and energy that an organization demands of its members (time and energy demand). We examine membership dynamics in an ecology where competitor organizations deploying varied strategies vie for the same pool of members. Results show a curvilinear relationship between membership growth and the rate of social encapsulation. Furthermore, we find that time and energy demand mediates the effect of social encapsulation by shaping its members’ opportunities for maintaining external affiliations. Different opportunity structures result in different levels of network turnover, thus either reinforcing or dissolving intra-organizational ties. For most types of organizations, attaining sustained growth requires a balance between open networks (for recruitment) and network closure (for retention).},

Both the rate of page growth and editor growth has declined. As growth has declined, there are indicators of increased coordination and overhead costs, exclusion of newcomers, and resistance to new edits.

  abstract = {Although analyzing user behavior within individual communities is an active and rich research domain, people usually interact with multiple communities both on- and off-line. How do users act in such multi-community environments? Although there are a host of intriguing aspects to this question, it has received much less attention in the research community in comparison to the intra-community case. In this paper, we examine three aspects of multi-community engagement: the sequence of communities that users post to, the language that users employ in those communities, and the feedback that users receive, using longitudinal posting behavior on Reddit as our main data source, and DBLP for auxiliary experiments. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of features drawn from these aspects in predicting users' future level of activity. One might expect that a user's trajectory mimics the "settling-down" process in real life: an initial exploration of sub-communities before settling down into a few niches. However, we find that the users in our data continually post in new communities; moreover, as time goes on, they post increasingly evenly among a more diverse set of smaller communities. Interestingly, it seems that users that eventually leave the community are "destined" to do so from the very beginning, in the sense of showing significantly different "wandering" patterns very early on in their trajectories; this finding has potentially important design implications for community maintainers. Our multi-community perspective also allows us to investigate the "situation vs. personality" debate from language usage across different communities.},

This suggests e-petitioning is competitive and that e-petitions draw on overlapping resource pools.

With the rise of large-scale social media systems, category schemes are being created by groups with differing perspectives, values, and expectations for how categories will be used. Prior studies of social tagging and folksonomy focused on the application and evolution of the collective category scheme, but struggled to uncover some of the collective rationale undergirding the decision-making processes in those schemes. In this paper, we qualitatively analyze the early discussions among editors of Wikipedia about the design and creation of its category system. We highlight three themes that dominated the discussion: hierarchy, scope and navigation, and relate these themes to their more formal roots in the information science literature. We distill out four styles of collaboration with regard to category systems that apply broadly to social tagging and other folksonomies. We conclude the paper with implications for collaborative tools and category systems as applied to large-scale collaborative systems.},

  abstract = {The extensive Wikipedia literature has largely considered Wikipedia in isolation, outside of the context of its broader Internet ecosystem. Very recent research has demonstrated the significance of this limitation, identifying critical relationships between Google and Wikipedia that are highly relevant to many areas of Wikipedia-based research and practice. This paper extends this recent research beyond search engines to examine Wikipedia's relationships with large-scale online communities, Stack Overflow and Reddit in particular. We find evidence of consequential, albeit unidirectional relationships. Wikipedia provides substantial value to both communities, with Wikipedia content increasing visitation, engagement, and revenue, but we find little evidence that these websites contribute to Wikipedia in return. Overall, these findings highlight important connections between Wikipedia and its broader ecosystem that should be considered by researchers studying Wikipedia. Critically, our results also emphasize the key role that volunteer-created Wikipedia content plays in improving other websites, even contributing to revenue generation.},

  abstract = {In many online platforms, people must choose how broadly to allocate their energy. Should one concentrate on a narrow area of focus, and become a specialist, or apply oneself more broadly, and become a generalist? In this work, we propose a principled measure of how generalist or specialist a user is, and study behavior in online platforms through this lens. To do this, we construct highly accurate community embeddings that represent communities in a high-dimensional space. We develop sets of community analogies and use them to optimize our embeddings so that they encode community relationships extremely well. Based on these embeddings, we introduce a natural measure of activity diversity, the GS-score. Applying our embedding-based measure to online platforms, we observe a broad spectrum of user activity styles, from extreme specialists to extreme generalists, in both community membership on Reddit and programming contributions on GitHub. We find that activity diversity is related to many important phenomena of user behavior. For example, specialists are much more likely to stay in communities they contribute to, but generalists are much more likely to remain on platforms as a whole. We also find that generalists engage with significantly more diverse sets of users than specialists do. Furthermore, our methodology leads to a simple algorithm for community recommendation, matching state-of-theart methods like collaborative filtering. Our methods and results introduce an important new dimension of online user behavior and shed light on many aspects of online platform use.},

  abstract = {The problem of reconstructing nonlinear and complex dynamical systems from measured data or time series is central to many scientific disciplines including physical, biological, computer, and social sciences, as well as engineering and economics. The classic approach to phase-space reconstruction through the methodology of delay-coordinate embedding has been practiced for more than three decades, but the paradigm is effective mostly for low-dimensional dynamical systems. Often, the methodology yields only a topological correspondence of the original system. There are situations in various fields of science and engineering where the systems of interest are complex and high dimensional with many interacting components. A complex system typically exhibits a rich variety of collective dynamics, and it is of great interest to be able to detect, classify, understand, predict, and control the dynamics using data that are becoming increasingly accessible due to the advances of modern information technology. To accomplish these goals, especially prediction and control, an accurate reconstruction of the original system is required. Nonlinear and complex systems identification aims at inferring, from data, the mathematical equations that govern the dynamical evolution and the complex interaction patterns, or topology, among the various components of the system. With successful reconstruction of the system equations and the connecting topology, it may be possible to address challenging and significant problems such as identification of causal relations among the interacting components and detection of hidden nodes. The “inverse” problem thus presents a grand challenge, requiring new paradigms beyond the traditional delay-coordinate embedding methodology. The past fifteen years have witnessed rapid development of contemporary complex graph theory with broad applications in interdisciplinary science and engineering. The combination of graph, information, and nonlinear dynamical systems theories with tools from statistical physics, optimization, engineering control, applied mathematics, and scientific computing enables the development of a number of paradigms to address the problem of nonlinear and complex systems reconstruction. In this Review, we describe the recent advances in this forefront and rapidly evolving field, with a focus on compressive sensing based methods. In particular, compressive sensing is a paradigm developed in recent years in applied mathematics, electrical engineering, and nonlinear physics to reconstruct sparse signals using only limited data. It has broad applications ranging from image compression/reconstruction to the analysis of large-scale sensor networks, and it has become a powerful technique to obtain high-fidelity signals for applications where sufficient observations are not available. We will describe in detail how compressive sensing can be exploited to address a diverse array of problems in data based reconstruction of nonlinear and complex networked systems. The problems include identification of chaotic systems and prediction of catastrophic bifurcations, forecasting future attractors of time-varying nonlinear systems, reconstruction of complex networks with oscillatory and evolutionary game dynamics, detection of hidden nodes, identification of chaotic elements in neuronal networks, reconstruction of complex geospatial networks and nodal positioning, and reconstruction of complex spreading networks with binary data.. A number of alternative methods, such as those based on system response to external driving, synchronization, and noise-induced dynamical correlation, will also be discussed. Due to the high relevance of network reconstruction to biological sciences, a special section is devoted to a brief survey of the current methods to infer biological networks. Finally, a number of open problems including control and controllability of complex nonlinear dynamical networks are discussed. The methods outlined in this Review are principled on various concepts in complexity science and engineering such as phase transitions, bifurcations, stabilities, and robustness. The methodologies have the potential to significantly improve our ability to understand a variety of complex dynamical systems ranging from gene regulatory systems to social networks toward the ultimate goal of controlling such systems.},

  abstract = {The dominant narrative of the Internet has been one of unconstrained growth, abundance, and plenitude. It is in this context that new forms of organizing, such as online groups, have emerged. However, the same factors that underlie the utopian narrative of Internet life also give rise to numerous online groups, many of which fail to attract participants or to provide significant value. This suggests that despite the potential transformative nature of modern information technology, issues of scarcity, competition, and context may remain critical to the performance and functioning of online groups. In this paper, we draw from organizational ecology theories to develop an ecological view of online groups to explain how overlapping membership among online groups causes intergroup competition for member attention and affects a group's ability to grow. Hypotheses regarding the effects of group size, age, and membership overlap on growth are proposed and tested with data from a 64-month, longitudinal sample of 240 online discussion groups. The analysis shows that sharing members with other groups reduced future growth rates, suggesting that membership overlap puts competitive pressure on online groups. Our results also suggest that, compared with smaller and younger groups, larger and older groups experience greater difficulty in growing their membership. In addition, larger groups were more vulnerable to competitive pressure than smaller groups: larger groups experienced greater difficulty in growing their membership than smaller groups as competition intensified. Overall, our findings show how an abundance of opportunities afforded by technologies can create scarcity in user time and effort, which increases competitive pressure on online groups. Our ecological view extends organizational ecology theory to new organizational forms online and highlights the importance of studying the competitive environment of online groups.},

This study employs the framework of density dependence to understand what drives the adoption of social media by organizations. Fixed-effects negative binominal regression models were run to test the hypotheses that predicted the founding rates of 2007 Chinese newspaper organizations in 31 provincial units on Sina Weibo from August 2009 to June 2015. The results show that the founding rate of party newspapers exhibits inverted U-shaped relationships to local or non-local party newspaper density and non-party newspaper density. At the same time, the density dependence hypothesis is supported only for the effect of non-party newspaper density outside the provincial unit on the founding rate of non-party newspapers. Unexpectedly, non-party newspaper density within the provincial boundary exerts no significant influence on this founding rate. Both local and non-local party newspaper densities significantly and negatively influence the decisions to start homepages on Sina Weibo among non-newspaper organizations. Discussion and implications are provided.},

Recent methods (convergent cross mapping, CCM) have made substantial progress on this problem by applying the idea of nonlinear attractor reconstruction to time series data. Here, we expand upon the technique of CCM by explicitly considering time lags. Applying this extended method to representative examples (model simulations, a laboratory predator-prey experiment, temperature and greenhouse gas reconstructions from the Vostok ice core, and long-term ecological time series collected in the Southern California Bight), we demonstrate the ability to identify different time-delayed interactions, distinguish between synchrony induced by strong unidirectional-forcing and true bidirectional causality, and resolve transitive causal chains.},

  abstract = {We discuss Bayesian forecasting of increasingly high-dimensional time series, a key area of application of stochastic dynamic models in the financial industry and allied areas of business. Novel state-space models characterizing sparse patterns of dependence among multiple time series extend existing multivariate volatility models to enable scaling to higher numbers of individual time series. The theory of these dynamic dependence network models shows how the individual series can be decoupled for sequential analysis and then recoupled for applied forecasting and decision analysis. Decoupling allows fast, efficient analysis of each of the series in individual univariate models that are linked – for later recoupling – through a theoretical multivariate volatility structure defined by a sparse underlying graphical model. Computational advances are especially significant in connection with model uncertainty about the sparsity patterns among series that define this graphical model; Bayesian model averaging using discounting of historical information builds substantially on this computational advance. An extensive, detailed case study showcases the use of these models and the improvements in forecasting and financial portfolio investment decisions that are achievable. Using a long series of daily international currencies, stock indices and commodity prices, the case study includes evaluations of multi-day forecasts and Bayesian portfolio analysis with a variety of practical utility functions, as well as comparisons against commodity trading advisor benchmarks.

Communities with many joint memberships may struggle to get enough of their members' time and attention, but find it easy to import best practices from other communities. In this paper, we study the effects of membership overlap on the survival of online communities. By analyzing the historical data of 5673 Wikia communities, we find that higher levels of membership overlap are positively associated with higher survival rates of online communities. Furthermore, we find that it is beneficial for young communities to have shared members who play a central role in other mature communities. Our contributions are two-fold. Theoretically, by examining the impact of membership overlap on the survival of online communities we identified an important mechanism underlying the success of online communities. Practically, our findings may guide community creators on how to effectively manage their members, and tool designers on how to support this task.},

In contrast, we take an ecological view to understand how the success of a community is influenced by other communities. We measured a community's relationship with other communities - its "niche" - through four dimensions: topic overlap, shared members, content linking, and shared offline organizational affiliation. We used a mixed-method approach, combining the quantitative analysis of 9495 online enterprise communities and interviews with community members. Our results show that too little or too much overlap in topic with other communities causes a community's activity to suffer. We also show that this main result is moderated in predictable ways by whether the community shares members with, links to content in, or shares an organizational affiliation with other communities. These findings provide new insight on community success, guiding online community designers on how to effectively position their community in relation to others.},
